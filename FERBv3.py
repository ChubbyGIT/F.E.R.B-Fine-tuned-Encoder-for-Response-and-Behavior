# Introduction
st.write("""
F.E.R.B is an advanced voice assistant powered by deep learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques, designed for intelligent and context-aware interactions. Unlike traditional assistants, F.E.R.B leverages **LLama 2**, a powerful transformer-based large language model (LLM) developed by Meta, for efficient and natural language generation.
